.header__lang-item .header__link_active {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/*I don't see another way of underlining header__link_active.
 I'm using mixin and .link class is setting
 text-decoration: none for header__link_active also.
Can you be so kind and show me correct way to do this part?

Text is underlined at 768px, please zoom in
due to font size reduction it's hardly visible*/
